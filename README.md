TEST DE CONJUGAISON

Website created with the intention of learning to conjugate verbs in French and practising a bit of JavaScript and CSS at the same time.

I learned a lot about the importance of using functions to reduce the size of code and make it easier to maintain.

Some improvements still need to be made on the conjugation of pronominal verbs, so that the entry of the verb and its conjugations are given with their respective pronouns.
